                    harm,
                    exposure of personal information, or DDOS attacks will be met with an immediate ban.

                    harassment will not be tolerated. This includes the use of racial, ethnic, or homophobic slurs.
                    Constant petty insults that create a toxic atmosphere will also not be allowed.
                    Punishments will be situational, but we reserve the right to ban a user should we judge the incident
                    to be severe.
                    Server staff may not be aware that something is considered hate speech, in this instance please open
                    a report. (See: Note 3)

                    Refrain from posting repeat messages, excessive capitalization, excessive emotes, excessive
                    arguments, and tagging people unnecessarily.
                    Make a reasonable effort to use channels for their respective purposes. If you aren&apos;t sure of a
                    channel&apos;s topic, check its description.
                    Additionally, English is the only language to be used in public channels. Most players here only understand English, as do the moderators. Please keep it to private messages with others who may understand.

                    or allowed.
                    Sexual/Adult content includes nudity, gore, etc. If you are unsure if it is considered
                    NSFW/suggestive.
                    Discussion of <span class="tooltip">hard drugs<span

                    This is not the place for you to promote your server. This does not mean talking about other servers
                    is outright banned. However, if you are slandering or found to be subtly attempting advertisement,
                    moderators will take action.
                    This rule also applies to other servers, advertisement of Horizon's End in any community where it is not allowed will be considered a violation of this rule.

                    The use of any hacked clients or mods/resource packs that give an unfair advantage over players is forbidden. This includes fly hacks, kill auras, speed hacks, aint-knockback, player highlighters, and x-ray to name a few. Use of hacks or unfair mods will be met with an extensive ban.

                    all containers, builds, and ships within. Additionally, it is recommended you get permission before
                    taking another player&apos;s ship from claimed land.
                    Ship ownership overrides that of the territory, this includes the ability to remove the ship from the claim. However the owner of the territory holds the right to take ownership of that ship, regardless of if it is locked.
                    Stealing crates or activating pistons to push crates also falls under this category, when the ship is in claimed land or a trade city.
                    Stealing and griefing the possessions of players with new player protection is not allowed, regardless of the land those contents were left in. Exceptions can be made for abandoned property.

                Do Not Kill New Players Unprovoked
                <p>
                    Newer players will have a grace period where they may play without fear of being attacked. If a new player provokes another through combat, they will lose this protection and you may attack them. If a player has a star beside their name in chat, they are considered a new player and you must not provoke them.

                <p>
                    The following are not allowed while you are under attack:

            <li id="boosting">
                No Boosting
                <p>
                    Boosting is the act of giving a player a substantial amount of credits for free in order to help them level up. This system was built with the idea of players working to level themselves. Any offense will be investigated and determined on a case-by-case basis, and we as a team will be determining whether a loophole was used or not.

                <p>
                    To keep within the spirit of Ship vs Ship combat, purposefully awkward ships that are designed only to break the meta will not be allowed. This may include spindly ships that are impossible to hit, abusing the small minimum block counts of shuttles, or anything designed to give an overwhelming advantage at the cost of immersion. This does not apply to immobile ships. Staff discretion is used to determine what is in violation of this rule.

                    Players should avoid actions that destroy the natural beauty of planets. Actions that may be covered under this rule maybe include: Large walls, and large scale surface mining.
